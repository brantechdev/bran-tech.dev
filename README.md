# 👋 Welcome to My Portfolio Repository

## About Me

Hi, I'm **Brandon** — a tax advisor and auditor with a background in law, accounting, and regulatory compliance. While my professional foundation is rooted in analytical thinking and precision, I'm now channeling that skill set into software development and data science.

## Interests

- 💻 Learning full-stack development with a focus on **data architecture**, **automation**, and **logic-driven systems**
- 📊 Using **data analytics** to explore thought-provoking questions, uncover unique insights, and investigate the topics that interest me personally and professionally
- 🧠 Building systems that merge **legal logic**, **data models**, and **programming** to solve complex problems in accessible, adaptable ways
- 🌐 Developing tools that reflect both technical clarity and real-world impact

## What I'm Working Toward

I’m currently learning foundational programming languages like **C** and **C++**, alongside modern technologies such as **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **SQL**. My goal is to create intelligent, modular software for interpreting complex rule sets—like tax legislation—and to eventually develop a dynamic rule engine capable of handling multi-jurisdictional logic.

This repository will host my personal website at [bran-tech.dev](https://bran-tech.dev), where I’ll showcase coding projects, writeups, and ideas as I grow in this space.

Thanks for stopping by!
